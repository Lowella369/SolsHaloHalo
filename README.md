# Sols Halo-Halo and Desserts Website

**Name: Lowella Fox**

**Description:** This is a business website for Sols Halo-Halo and Dessert. I've created this as one of my first project for the Web Development Bootcamp in Texas A & M. The website has home page, about-us page, news and contact page. 

**Functionality:** In the home page you will see slide show of images of Sols Halo-Halo and Dessert products and etc. And when you click the Our Story link you will learn it's history or about Sols Halo Halo and where they got the name Sols. In the News Page, there you will learn their new branches to be opened or new dessert that will be available and other news/promo about their product. And in the franchise page, there you contact them if you want to franchise with them or you have a proposal to them. 

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript 

**Future Improvement:**

1. Need to improve the footer 
2. The Navigation Bar 
3. The text of the branches in the header and the font style or color of the page contents
